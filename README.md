Created the project in github.

Welcome

This is my entry for LudumDare 53 Game Jam within the theme "Delivery".

You are the pizza delivery guy! Your task is to go to the pizza house, grab some pizza, then move to the house that made the delivery. The neighborhood is full of terrors… Well, actually not “real” terrors, but.. Cats, which might be worse than terrors but whatever. Smart and evil cats are spawning from the trashcans of the city and they start to run after you to get your pizza. You can give them some slices from the ordered pizza, but remember the more pizza slices you give to the cats\n the less time you will be rewarded at then end of the delivery and you have to consider that time is your friend, because if you run out of time you lose.

Last but not least, if a cat runs into you then it takes 2-4 pizza slices from you.

Thanks a lot for your time and have fun!!!
